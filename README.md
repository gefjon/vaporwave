# Vaporwave - a web design project

This project uses [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html),
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
plus [Gnu Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to handle compilation.

Install those things, run `make` in the project's root, and then get an
http server of some description to serve `src/demo.html` to see what's
going on.
